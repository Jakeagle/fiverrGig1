            Have you ever crossed paths with a complete stranger and instantly
            felt you have known them all along?
          </p>

          <p class="aboutText">
            Or walked into a coffee shop and had a conversation that changed
            your day, your week or your life?

          <p class="aboutText">
            Have you ever been moved to tears of joy and gratitude by a
            beautiful sunset, a kind gesture, or a random person or thing
            showing up at just the right time?
          </p>

          <p class="aboutText">
            These are the types of experiences that people have when they meet
            and work with Bonnie L Silver. She is modest and completely
            unattached to the fact that she has a profoundly positive impact on
            the people she comes in contact with and the fact that, with little
            effort, they are transformed into her obvious and contagious joy,
            intuition, generosity and loving spirit.
          </p>

          <p class="aboutText">
            Bonnie has an eclectic background and has traveled the world as a
            flight attendant, and then serving over 6 years in the U.S. Army.
            After earning her Master of Business Administration in 2003, Bonnie
            entered corporate America but everything changed in 2008. After
            being downsized from her sales position, Bonnie found herself making
            the choice to move into volunteering and being of service, with a
            variety of nonprofits including the support of Veterans in
            transition.
          </p>

          <p class="aboutText">
            During the past few decades, Bonnie has invested in her education
            and both personal and spiritual development, knowing that learning
            is a life- long process. It is from this vantage point that Bonnie
            best serves her clients in helping them grow, expand, and succeed in
            their lives. A phrase that rolls effortlessly off Bonnie’s tongue
            is, “How may I best serve you?” Her concern is always for other
            people’s well-being and ensuring that their highest priority needs
            are being addressed. Wrapped in a warm blanket of love, her words
            and actions come from a servant- heart, from the deepest recesses of
            her soul. Which is what causes her to stand out in a world that at
            times has forgotten how to be there for others.

    <!--One thing you may have noticed is the frequent use of "class"-->
    <!--Class is used for Css, and gives an HTML element unique identifiers you can target to style the element in different ways-->
    <!--You can add as many class tags as you want, and all of them are accesible in CSS-->
